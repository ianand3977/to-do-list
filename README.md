## Code Explanation

### HTML

The HTML file creates the basic structure of the To-Do List app, including the input box, add button, and the list container where tasks are displayed.

### CSS

The CSS file styles the To-Do List app, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. It includes styles for the container, input box, buttons, and list items.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript file contains the core functionality of the To-Do List app. It includes functions to add tasks, mark them as completed, remove tasks, and save/load tasks to/from local storage.

#### Functions:

- **addTask()**: Adds a new task to the list. If the input box is empty, it alerts the user to enter a task.
- **saveData()**: Saves the current list of tasks to local storage.
- **showTask()**: Loads tasks from local storage when the page is loaded or refreshed.
- **Event Listeners**: Handles click events on list items and close buttons to mark tasks as completed or remove them, respectively.

## Local Storage

The app uses the browser's local storage to save tasks, ensuring that tasks persist even after the page is refreshed. This is handled by the `saveData()` and `showTask()` functions.
